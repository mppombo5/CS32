# CS 32 - UCLA, Winter Quarter 2019

This is my repository for Intro to Computer Science II (Object-Oriented Programming, Algorithms, and Data Structures), taken with [Prof. Carey Nachenberg](http://careynachenberg.weebly.com/) during winter quarter of 2019.

**Disclaimer:** this repository is for professional purposes, so that prospective employers may judge my mastery of relevant materials. You are more than welcome to inspect and analyze it, but any direct usage of my code in your own CS 32 projects is done without my knowledge and at your own risk.

## Project Scores

Unfortunately, Prof. Smallberg has a habit of deleting the course website once the quarter is over, so I can't provide links to the website or the actual project specs. The table below includes a brief description of each project so you can get idea of what the goal was. (Admittedly, the description might not be 100% accurate since I'm going off of my memory from 1.5 years ago.)

| Project | Grade | Brief Description |
|:-------:|:-----:|-------------------|
| [Proj. 1](Project%201) | 100/100 | Organize our text-based minigame from CS 31 into several header and source files, from the original single source file. |
| [Proj. 2](Project%202) | 86/100 | Implement a basic Set class using linked lists as the underlying data structure. (*Note: I only failed one test case out of 80, but forgot to finish my report and lost 13 easy points because of it.*) |
| [Proj. 3](Project%203) | 98/100 | ZombieDash: a 2D run-and-gun minigame. We were provided assets and basic driver code, and were tasked with implementing all the game logic. [Separate repository here](https://github.com/mppombo5/ZombieDash). |
| [Proj. 4](Project%204) | 82/100 | A genome sequencing program that utilizes a [Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) for sequence matching. |

## Homework Assignments

Along with the four main projects, we were also assigned 5 smaller homework assignments throughout the course of the quarter. My memory of these assignments is **far** less clear than that of the projects, and as such I don't even know what subject they're supposed to demonstrate knowledge of. If you are at all interested, the directories containing my submissions for these homeworks is also available in this repository.
